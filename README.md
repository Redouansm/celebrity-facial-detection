Celebrity Facial Detection
This project implements a facial detection system focused on recognizing celebrities from images. It leverages machine learning techniques to detect and identify faces in images, with a potential focus on a dataset of celebrity faces. The system is designed to process images, extract facial features, and classify them using a trained model.
Description
The Celebrity Facial Detection project aims to:

Detect faces in images using computer vision techniques.
Extract facial features to identify specific celebrities.
Provide a user-friendly interface or script to test the model with new images.

The project likely includes:

Preprocessing steps such as face detection and normalization.
Feature extraction using techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or deep learning-based embeddings.
A classification model (e.g., Support Vector Classifier or a neural network) trained on a dataset of celebrity images.

Features

Face Detection: Identifies faces within input images.
Celebrity Recognition: Classifies detected faces as belonging to specific celebrities.
Preprocessing: Normalizes images (e.g., resizing, grayscale conversion) for consistent input.
Visualization: Displays processed images and prediction results.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Libraries: 
OpenCV (opencv-python) for face detection and image processing
Scikit-learn (scikit-learn) for machine learning models
NumPy (numpy) for numerical operations
Pillow (pillow) for image handling
Matplotlib (matplotlib) for visualization (optional)
(Optional) Deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch if using neural networks



Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Redouansm/celebrity-facial-detection.git
cd celebrity-facial-detection


Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not provided, install manually:
pip install opencv-python scikit-learn numpy pillow matplotlib


Download or prepare the dataset:

The project may require a dataset of celebrity images (e.g., CelebA or a custom dataset).
Ensure the trained model file (e.g., model.pkl) is available or train the model as described in the project scripts.



Usage

Run the main script (replace app.py with the actual script name if different):
python app.py


Follow the instructions:

Upload an image containing a face via the interface or command line.
The system will detect the face, extract features, and predict the celebrity identity.


View results:

The script may output the predicted celebrity name and confidence score.
Visualizations of detected faces or processed images may be displayed.



Dataset

The project likely uses a dataset of celebrity images, such as CelebA or a custom-curated set.
Images should be preprocessed to ensure consistency (e.g., aligned faces, uniform size).
Details on obtaining or preparing the dataset should be included in the project files.

Example
Example usage:

Input an image of a celebrity.
The system detects the face and outputs the predicted celebrity name, e.g., "Brad Pitt" with a confidence score of 0.95.
Visualizations show the detected face and extracted features.

Limitations

Accuracy depends on the quality and diversity of the training dataset.
Challenges with poor lighting, occlusions, or non-frontal faces.
Limited to celebrities included in the training data.
Potential improvements: Use deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for better accuracy or expand the dataset.
