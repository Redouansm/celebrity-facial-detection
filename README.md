# Celebrity Facial Detection

This project implements a facial detection system focused on recognizing celebrities from images. It leverages machine learning techniques to detect and identify faces in images, with a potential focus on a dataset of celebrity faces. The system is designed to process images, extract facial features, and classify them using a trained model.

## Description

The **Celebrity Facial Detection** project aims to:
- Detect faces in images using computer vision techniques.
- Extract facial features to identify specific celebrities.
- Provide a user-friendly interface or script to test the model with new images.

The project likely includes:
- Preprocessing steps such as face detection and normalization.
- Feature extraction using techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or deep learning-based embeddings.
- A classification model (e.g., Support Vector Classifier or a neural network) trained on a dataset of celebrity images.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Identifies faces within input images.
- **Celebrity Recognition**: Classifies detected faces as belonging to specific celebrities.
- **Preprocessing**: Normalizes images (e.g., resizing, grayscale conversion) for consistent input.
- **Visualization**: Displays processed images and prediction results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - OpenCV (`opencv-python`) for face detection and image processing
  - Scikit-learn (`scikit-learn`) for machine learning models
  - NumPy (`numpy`) for numerical operations
  - Pillow (`pillow`) for image handling
  - Matplotlib (`matplotlib`) for visualization (optional)
  - (Optional) Deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch if using neural networks
